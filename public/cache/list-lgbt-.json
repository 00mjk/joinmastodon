Notre modération est collaborative, n’hésitez surtout pas à rapporter tout contenu problématique !\r\n\r\nNotre instance est bien sûr régie par des règles spécifiques. Premièrement aucun sexisme, racisme, homophobie validisme, âgisme, grossophobie ou psychophobie, etc n’est toléré. Tout message de haine est proscrit, les fascistes et leurs copains nazis sont directement bannis. Dans un autre registre, la publication de spam, de contenu pornographique non désigné comme tel avec un “Content Warning” (CW) mènent aussi à une exclusion du serveur. Cette instance Mastodon se veut inclusive et bienveillante, ainsi nous bannirons sans prévenir et sans regret. Les comptes bannis ne sont plus accessibles depuis notre instance, vous ne pouvez plus voir leur contenu ni les suivre.\r\nNous encourageons nos utilisateur-ice-s à utiliser la fonction de rapport (“Report”) pour nous faire part du contenu et/ou des comptes allant à l’encontre de nos règles. D'ailleurs si celles-ci ne vous conviennent pas, ne râlez pas, trouvez simplement un autre serveur.\r\nNous essayons aussi de mettre en avant l’aspect activiste de notre démarche. Si vous êtes un-e commercial-e, communiquant-e, travaillant dans le #digital, chez Orange ou la #FrenchTech sachez que vous n’êtes pas le/la bienvenu-e. Pendant que nous y sommes si l’écriture inclusive vous dérange sachez que vous n'êtes qu'à un clic de souris de la sortie.\r\nNotre réseau social, et son réseau entier selon nous, est dédié à la réappropriation des moyens de communication et à la création de communautés meilleures pour le collectif. Les catégories de personnes citées dans le paragraphe précédent n'oeuvrant pas du tout (allant même dans le sens contraire) à la réalisation de ces objectifs, elles sont logiquement pas les bienvenues.

A pipou is a complex creature that might be described in one sentence: someone who is either nice, either aiming to be nice.\r\nOur values:\r\n- Pipou Academy puts an emphasis on kindness. Our goal is to create a welcoming, laid-back space where everyone can feel at ease and be theirselves (as long as \"theirselves\" is not \"a big meanie\"!).\r\n- We welcome all the letters from the LGBT+ sigils, as well as allies. Whoever you are, you are welcome here, as long as you try to follow our rules!","topic":null,"languages":["en","fr"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_nocw","illegalContentLinks","spam","advertising","spoilers_nocw"],"categories":["lgbt"]},"thumbnail":"https://pipou.academy/packs/preview-9a17d32fc48369e8ccd910a75260e67d.jpg","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/c023647738936c7d0f049135e15ab3fff94eaeea/68747470733a2f2f7069706f752e61636164656d792f7061636b732f707265766965772d39613137643332666334383336396538636364393130613735323630653637642e6a7067","active_users":7},{"id":"5ac3c264757c830f5331d580","name":"sosh.network","added_at":"2018-04-03T18:05:24.727Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T16:45:08.958Z","checked_at":"2018-05-10T17:34:15.371Z","uptime":1,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.3.3","ipv6":false,"https_score":80,"https_rank":"A","obs_score":null,"obs_rank":null,"users":15,"statuses":51,"connections":174,"open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"An open Mastodon instance designed for free thinkers","full_description":"We started this instance of Mastodon to have an enclave where free thinkers can come to share, defend, and spread their ideas.","topic":null,"languages":["en"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["spam","advertising"],"categories":["games","journalism","lgbt","music","tech"]},"thumbnail":"https://sosh.network/system/site_uploads/files/000/000/001/original/SOSH.network_banner.jpg","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/d72dc132838973663b97e6a61c9d6d2ffc00a169/68747470733a2f2f736f73682e6e6574776f726b2f73797374656d2f736974655f75706c6f6164732f66696c65732f3030302f3030302f3030312f6f726967696e616c2f534f53482e6e6574776f726b5f62616e6e65722e6a7067","active_users":6},{"id":"5aca577ae41f80378b42e4b2","name":"gay.nsfw.onl","added_at":"2018-04-08T17:55:06.535Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T17:24:50.289Z","checked_at":"2018-05-10T17:34:46.608Z","uptime":1,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.3.3","ipv6":true,"https_score":80,"https_rank":"A","obs_score":null,"obs_rank":null,"users":19,"statuses":797,"connections":330,"open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"An invite-only, gay-themed, NSFW Mastodon instance.","full_description":"Hi.

Please read it carefully to make sure you agree with everything listed; we want to be a welcoming instance, but if our instance is not a good fit for your views or intentions we want you to find a place that fits better for your content. :)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Be nice!</h2>\r\n<p>This is a <em>community</em> of people (that is, by federating with other instances, connected to other communities of people). So when interacting with others, we expect that you will make every effort to be compassionate to other users. If you find this to be a difficult thing with a particular user, we encourage use of block and/or mute options, or you can always discuss things with <a href=\"https://witchey.club/@witch_min\">@witch_min</a>. (If a user is breaking this Code of Conduct, however, please <em>report them</em> and the matter will be taken care of asap.)</p>\r\n<p>This also includes not posting content that is racist, anti-semitic, misogynist, homophobic, biphobic, transphobic or transmisogynist, ableist, or furthering or promoting hatred or harm towards any oppressed group.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>No harassment. Period.</h2>\r\n<p>This includes:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>dogpiling</li>\r\n<li>attempting to evade someone blocking you</li>\r\n<li>directing others to attack someone</li>\r\n<li>spreading false information about someone</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If someone is breaking our Code of Conduct, again, please <em>report them</em>, don't dogpile them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Please use the CW feature for:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Any kind of sexual content and/or nudity (including via text)</li>\r\n<li>Political discussion</li>\r\n<li>Mental health discussion (including suicide)</li>\r\n<li>Flashing gifs or flashing videos</li>\r\n<li>Drug and alcohol use</li>\r\n<li>Medical or weight related topics (including diet and food)</li>\r\n<li>Violence or death (of people or of animals), including discussion of abuse or sexual violence</li>\r\n<li>Ranting or \"subtoots\" about any user</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Why?</h4>\r\n<p>These are topics that are commonly upsetting or triggering to many people. As a welcoming and friendly space for social conversation, we want to make sure everyone is as comfortable here as they want to be. Using the CW (content warning) feature for these things or any topic you personally feel may be upsetting gives other users the option of determining whether or not they're in a state of mind capable of reading these topics. It's a way of letting people decide what to engage with.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Please use the \"unlisted\" feature for:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Any posts from bot accounts (including but not limited to image bots and \"ebooks\" style bots)</li>\r\n<li>Making large amounts of toots in short periods of time</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Why?</h4>\r\n<p>Our Mastodon instance federates with other instances. This means that our public toots appear on the \"federated timeline\" of any instance we're federating with. If an instance has a large amount of annoying or spam content flooding the federated timeline, the entire instance may be silenced by the admins of other instances. We want to avoid that! Please help us in this endeavor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>We don't want ANY of the following content AT ALL:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>any kind of sexual content involving anyone under the age of 18, including written or drawn content</li>\r\n<li>any kind of sexual content directed at a user who has not consented to it</li>\r\n<li>Holocaust denial, Nazi symbolism, or any anti-semitic or pro-white supremacist content</li>\r\n<li>pro-fascist or pro- violent nationalist content</li>\r\n<li>Islamophobic content</li>\r\n<li>mockery of people asking for donations</li>\r\n<li>antagonism towards sex workers</li>\r\n<li>content defending any of the above</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\r\n<p>Don't be an asshole, and use the CW and privacy features appropriately.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>If you break the rules...</h2>\r\n<p>You will be spoken to by @witch_min about the issue.
