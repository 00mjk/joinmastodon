Dans un autre registre, la publication de spam, de contenu pornographique non désigné comme tel avec un “Content Warning” (CW) mènent aussi à une exclusion du serveur. Cette instance Mastodon se veut inclusive et bienveillante, ainsi nous bannirons sans prévenir et sans regret. Les comptes bannis ne sont plus accessibles depuis notre instance, vous ne pouvez plus voir leur contenu ni les suivre.\r\nNous encourageons nos utilisateur-ice-s à utiliser la fonction de rapport (“Report”) pour nous faire part du contenu et/ou des comptes allant à l’encontre de nos règles.

If you do not pay to \"boost\" each post, a Facebook page will only reach 3-6% of members.

It remains possible for members of each to instance to interact with others.\r\nThere is no monopoly by a single commercial company, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to help activism/campaigning groups to make this step now.\r\nhttps://campaign.openworlds.info\r\nhttps://activism.openworlds.info","topic":"Campaigning and NGO groups working for a better world","languages":["en"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_all","spam","advertising"],"categories":["academia","activism","journalism","tech"]},"thumbnail":"https://campaign.openworlds.info/packs/preview-9a17d32fc48369e8ccd910a75260e67d.jpg","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/e109c5f1aca2396a07b75f404301159ae5a0ab96/68747470733a2f2f63616d706169676e2e6f70656e776f726c64732e696e666f2f7061636b732f707265766965772d39613137643332666334383336396538636364393130613735323630653637642e6a7067","active_users":16},{"id":"5aca0d01e41f80378b42e4b0","name":"mstdn.id","added_at":"2018-04-08T12:37:21.878Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T17:26:26.258Z","checked_at":"2018-05-10T17:32:30.085Z","uptime":1,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.3.3","ipv6":false,"https_score":null,"https_rank":null,"obs_score":null,"obs_rank":null,"users":26,"statuses":631,"connections":580,"open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"Mastodon instance not just for fun.

People and organisations who feel this way are our initial targets.\r\n\r\nWe are launching two new Mastodon instances for activists and campaigners to aid communication of grassroot groups; putting social media back in our hands by providing a free, unfettered home for campaigners, NGO’s and activists to communicate among their peers and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis project is a way out of the restricted, algorithmic, for-profit mediation and commercialisation of communication we increasingly experience. If you do not pay to \"boost\" each post, a Facebook page will only reach 3-6% of members. This soon becomes an expensive drain on limited NGO and activist budgets. \r\nActivists and campaigners alike are ready to shift their outreach away from the corporate social networks paid-per-view “walled gardens”.\r\n\r\nMastodon is the worlds largest free open source decentralised microblogging network; it’s thousands of unique, interconnected communities, filled with different people, interests, languages, and needs. \r\nYou’re free to join any community you like, or better yet, host your own, on your own terms. It remains possible for members of each to instance to interact with others. \r\nThere is no monopoly by a single commercial company, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to help activism/campaigning groups to make this step now.\r\n\r\nhttps://campaign.openworlds.info \r\nhttps://activism.openworlds.info","topic":" Its an unfettered space for Activists and groups to communicate via #openweb projects.","languages":["en"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_nocw","spam","advertising"],"categories":["academia","activism","journalism","tech"]},"thumbnail":"https://storage.gra3.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_91eb37814936490c95da7b85993cc2ff/activism/site_uploads/files/000/000/001/original/coldrean_small_300.png","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/720644510eddfc282031317ee544a8e9926bc6a0/68747470733a2f2f73746f726167652e677261332e636c6f75642e6f76682e6e65742f76312f415554485f39316562333738313439333634393063393564613762383539393363633266662f616374697669736d2f736974655f75706c6f6164732f66696c65732f3030302f3030302f3030312f6f726967696e616c2f636f6c647265616e5f736d616c6c5f3330302e706e67","active_users":9},{"id":"5ae5aa407c34d663c019293a","name":"cheeky.red","added_at":"2018-04-29T11:19:28.583Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T16:42:52.862Z","checked_at":"2018-05-10T17:34:52.806Z","uptime":1,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.3.3","ipv6":false,"https_score":null,"https_rank":null,"obs_score":null,"obs_rank":null,"users":11,"statuses":179,"connections":18,"open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"Mastodon instance hosted in Vietnam","full_description":"We’ve set up a Commie Twitter clone for those at risk of suspension / shadowbans etc\r\n\r\nWe host it, we secure it, we manage it, we moderate it.
