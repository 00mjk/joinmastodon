People and organisations who feel this way are our initial targets.\r\n\r\nWe are launching two new Mastodon instances for activists and campaigners to aid communication of grassroot groups; putting social media back in our hands by providing a free, unfettered home for campaigners, NGO‚Äôs and activists to communicate among their peers and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis project is a way out of the restricted, algorithmic, for-profit mediation and commercialisation of communication we increasingly experience. If you do not pay to \"boost\" each post, a Facebook page will only reach 3-6% of members.

It remains possible for members of each to instance to interact with others. \r\nThere is no monopoly by a single commercial company, no ads, and no tracking.\r\n\r\nWe aim to help activism/campaigning groups to make this step now.\r\n\r\nhttps://campaign.openworlds.info \r\nhttps://activism.openworlds.info","topic":" Its an unfettered space for Activists and groups to communicate via #openweb projects.","languages":["en"],"other_languages_accepted":true,"federates_with":null,"prohibited_content":["nudity_nocw","pornography_nocw","spam","advertising"],"categories":["academia","activism","journalism","tech"]},"thumbnail":"https://storage.gra3.cloud.ovh.net/v1/AUTH_91eb37814936490c95da7b85993cc2ff/activism/site_uploads/files/000/000/001/original/coldrean_small_300.png","thumbnail_proxy":"https://camo.instances.social/720644510eddfc282031317ee544a8e9926bc6a0/68747470733a2f2f73746f726167652e677261332e636c6f75642e6f76682e6e65742f76312f415554485f39316562333738313439333634393063393564613762383539393363633266662f616374697669736d2f736974655f75706c6f6164732f66696c65732f3030302f3030302f3030312f6f726967696e616c2f636f6c647265616e5f736d616c6c5f3330302e706e67","active_users":9},{"id":"5a88c6deefd18a117ddd3600","name":"mstdn.gnous.eu","added_at":"2018-02-18T00:20:46.639Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T06:14:43.627Z","checked_at":"2018-05-10T06:25:22.185Z","uptime":1,"up":true,"dead":false,"version":"2.3.3","ipv6":false,"https_score":80,"https_rank":"A","obs_score":75,"obs_rank":"B","users":15,"statuses":184,"connections":615,"open_registrations":true,"info":{"short_description":"Instance de la communaut√© Gnous.EU // En ligne depuis le 2018-02-17","full_description":"Mstdn.Gnous.eu est l'instance de la communaut√© Gnous.EU ouverte √† tous et r√©guli√®rement tenue √† jour.
